# credit-card-anomoly-detection
Just playing around with some ML models, hyperparameter testing, sklearn pipelines and transformers.

A machine learning model that detects whether or not a credit card purchase is fraudulent.

The dataset I used to build this model can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.
